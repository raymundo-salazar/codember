# Execute resolutions

For this project I created a command line app with node js. To see the resolution of the challenges follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository.

Using git clone the repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raymundo-salazar/codember.git
```

#### 2. Install the dependencies

To install the dependencies you can use the package manager of your choice: npm, pnpm or yarn.

with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Execute the `codember` command

To make the `codember` command available in your terminal you can perform two actions:

- **Install the program globally:** To do this you must run the command `npm install -g .` in the root folder of the project. Once the process is finished you will have the `codember` command available in your terminal.

- Another way you can run it is with the internal script `codember` which you can access with the command.

  with npm:

  ```bash
  npm run codember
  ```

  with yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn codember
  ```

  with pnpm:

  ```bash
  pnpm codember
  ```

#### 4. Ready!

Now the `codember` command is available to be executed.
First I recommend that you run the `codember help` command so that you can see all the options available to you.

##### Executing a resolution

```bash
## codember challenge <number>
codember challenge 1
```

##### Get the chanllenge description

```bash
codember challenge 1 -d
```

##### Supported languages

The CLI application supports English (en) and Spanish (es). You can use the `-l` flag to switch between languages. By default the English language is selected.

```bash
codember challenge -l "es" 1 -d
```

##### About me

If you want to know a little more about me you can use this command

```bash
codember about_me
```
